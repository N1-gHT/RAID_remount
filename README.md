# RAID_remount
## Bash script which able you to remount automaticly your RAID1  
Will be able soon  

## Dependances
I'm currently using 3 programs for my script
* MDADM, this program is used for remount the RAID
* GDISK and SGDISK, to copy the partition table form disk 1 to disk 2
* NWIPE, to wipe the disk 2 to ensure that it is empty
